Saint Leo University Alma Mater

Saint Leo we salute traditions new and old,
Which guide us as we grow,
In body, heart and soul.
Everywhere we flourish sustained by our ideal,
Of challenging our minds to make our vision real.

Joyfully we gather, our destinies to seek,
Partners in harmony united yet unique.
Excellence in work and deed,
We’ve made our final quest,
We care for all creation, with compassion and respect.

Saint Leo we salute traditions new and old,
Which guide us as we grow,
In body, heart and soul.
Everywhere we flourish sustained by our ideal,
Of challenging our minds to make our vision real.
